        by defining special methods, you can specify the behavior on operators on progarmmer defined types
        for example, you can define a method named __add__ for the Time class, and you can use the + operator on tiem objects
        changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with programmer defined types is called operator overloading
        for every operator in python there is a corresponding special method

# the syntax for a function call, print_time(start) suggests that the function is an active agent
#it says something like "hey print time! Heres an object for you to print"

#in object oriented programming- the objets are the active agents. 
# a method invocation like start.print_time() says " hey start, print yourself"

else:
d[c] = d[c]+1
return d
This function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries, as long as the elements of
s are hashable, so they can be used as keys in d.
>>> t = ['spam', 'egg', 'spam', 'spam', 'bacon', 'spam']
>>> histogram(t)
{'bacon': 1, 'egg': 1, 'spam': 4}
Functions that work with several types are called polymorphic. Polymorphism can facilitate
code reuse. For example, the built-in function sum, which adds the elements of a
sequence, works as long as the elements of the sequence support additi

If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in
function hasattr

Another way to access attributes is the built-in function vars, which takes an object and
returns a dictionary that maps from attribute names (as strings) to their values:
>>> p = Point(3, 4)
>>> vars(p)
{'y': 4, 'x': 3}
For purposes of debugging, you might find it useful to keep this function handy:
def print_attributes(obj):
for attr in vars(obj):
print(attr, getattr(obj, attr))
print_attributes traverses the dictionary and prints each attribute name and its corresponding
value.
The built-in function getattr takes an object and an attribute name (as a string) and returns
the attributeâ€™s value.
